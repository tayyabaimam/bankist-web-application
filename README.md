FEATURES:
A banking website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
In this project, I created a fully-functional bank website with a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes. The site features the following users to easily navigate through the different sections of the page:
- smooth scrolling functionality
- lazy loading
- sticky navigation
- customer carousel
- login and delete account
- transfer money to a separate account
- loan application
